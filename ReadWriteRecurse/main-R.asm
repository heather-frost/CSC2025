; x86 uses 8 registers. EAX (Extended AX register has 32 bits while AX is the right most 16 bits of EAX). AL is the right-most 8 bits.
; Writing into AX or AL effects the right most bits of EAX.

;     EBX - Callee saved register
;     ECX - Caller saved register - Counter register 
;     EDX - Caller Saved register - data, I use it for saving and restoring the return address
;     ESI - Callee Saved register - Source Index
;     EDI - Callee Saved register - Destination Index
