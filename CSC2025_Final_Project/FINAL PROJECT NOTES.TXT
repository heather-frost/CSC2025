CLARIFIED ASSIGNMENT TEXT:
Write an assembly program. 

program must prompt user for input

program must process input

program must display output

program does not need to handle unsigned integers

[NOT RELEVANT TO NONCALCULATOR PROGRAM] The program should be able to handle any number upto 65,000.

Requirements to be fulfilled:
1) Program should have at least five procedures
a) E.g. main, readline , writeline, atoi, itoa
2) Each procedure should live in itâ€™s own .asm file
3) The only external functions the program can use are from
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/console-functions:
a) GetStdHandle
b) ReadConsole
c) WriteConsole
d) ExitProcess
4) All numbers can be unsigned numbers
5) Should be able to handle numbers as large as 65000
6) You will need to use the mul and div instructions to be found on the attached pages.
7) All the numbers inputted to and outputted will be decimal integers.

Program flow/pseudocode:

SETUP
set score to 0
generate random number 0-3
	populate 25 entries

mark all entries (separate array?) as faceDown

	INFO VALUES
		sum elements in array
		count instances of value in array

		sum elements in position N in arrays
		count instances of value in position N in arrays

GAMELOOP
refresh display
	grid: faceDown=X, faceUp=EntryValue
	info values
	score
accept user input
first entered value: which array
second entered value: which value in that array
	2-dimensional arrays in assembly?

if value in input entry=0: jmp GAME OVER

mark entry faceUp
update score:
	if score=0: add entry
	else: MUL score, entry

check for facedown 2s
	if none, check for facedown 3s
		if none, VICTORY

jmp GAMELOOP

GAMEOVER
	display "You blew up. Play again? y/n"

VICTORY
	display "You win! Your score was " + score
	display "Play again? y/n"

2D ARRAY POPULATION/MANIPULATION
	secondary array for facing?

RANDOM NUMBER GENERATION

DISPLAY
	ASCII first
	Irvine if time
		add to main first
		add to others if necessary

ACCEPT USER INPUT

ADDITIONS
	How To Section
	High Scores
		Need to input a name
	add a "keep going?" step

printing probably has to be done in gameloop

store other routines elsewhere

Interrrupts? (INT)
	INT 10h ;apparently this should clear the screen but throws exception
