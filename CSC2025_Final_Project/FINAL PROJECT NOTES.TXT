Program flow/pseudocode:

SETUP
set score to 0
generate random number 0-3
	populate 25 entries

mark all entries (separate array?) as faceDown

	INFO VALUES
		sum elements in array
		count instances of value in array

		sum elements in position N in arrays
		count instances of value in position N in arrays

GAMELOOP
refresh display
	grid: faceDown=X, faceUp=EntryValue
	info values
	score
accept user input
first entered value: which array
second entered value: which value in that array
	2-dimensional arrays in assembly?

if value in input entry=0: jmp GAME OVER

mark entry faceUp
update score:
	if score=0: add entry
	else: MUL score, entry

check for facedown 2s
	if none, check for facedown 3s
		if none, VICTORY

jmp GAMELOOP

GAMEOVER
	display "You blew up. Play again? y/n"

VICTORY
	display "You win! Your score was " + score
